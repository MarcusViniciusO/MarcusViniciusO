<h3 align='center'> Hi there üëã</h3>


## I'm Marcus Vinicius üòÅ

- üå± I'm currently learning programming (both front-end and back-end)

### About me

I worked for many years in the commercial area, dealing with people, using skills and mentalities such as communication and persistence, to succeed in my activities. And now I am in the process of migrating from the area. Basically, I formed my curriculum to work with integrated management systems.

What I want in the technology area is to gather all my knowledge, and apply it in my day to day, in the formation of new applications for clients, use good communication to work in a team, be proactive in dealing with problems and seek always more knowledge.
